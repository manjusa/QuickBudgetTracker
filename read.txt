1)Sample initial json -sampleInitialJSON
This shows how the json format is at the beginning

2) Once you update and add new items ,JSON will be updated - sampleUpdatedJSON
In this sample json, we have three keys
"itemdetails","items","total"
"items" are used for displaying chart on load of the page.
"itemdetails" on the otherhand are for drill down and viewing items in more detail
"total" is the total budget set

3)We use jquery canvas to display chart. It requires data in below format (as shown in data below)
_data= [{label: "furniture"
y: 55.55555555555556}
]

4) We have two variables which we use for displaychart and drilldown. These variables 
are "_arrayOfDataChart" and "_drillDownArrayJson" respectively. Below is a sample of them

5)Used jsonbin instead of database
6)can create your own sqllite db etc to store json
