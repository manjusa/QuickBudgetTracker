# QuickBudgetTracker
budget tracker

This is an application i created for managing budget quickly.The application allows users to setup a budget and then add expenses to 
see how much budget is still remaining.I use jquery canvas to create pie chart for the visuals.
This is built purely using jquery,javascript,jquery canvas and jsonbin (to store json in the cloud instead of any database)

github link to source code is : https://github.com/manjusa/QuickBudgetTracker.git.

This demo is used in my website "http://manjustechblog.com/blogs/JS/quickbudgetingtool.html"
Its open source code and can be extended if required
